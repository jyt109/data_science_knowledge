## Deeplearning knowledge

This is an effort to curate use cases and code examples of exisiting deeplearning libraries. There will also be notes about the the theory of deeplearning added in due course. 

**Deeplearning Techinques**
- Feedforward
- BackPropagation
- Convolution
- RBM (Restricted Boltzman's Machine)
- LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)


**Deepinglearning Libraries*

- Deeplearning4j (Java)
- Caffe (Mostly for Python)
- Lasagne (Python)
- Scikit-neuralnet (Python)
- [Chainer](http://chainer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/optimizers.html) (Python)
- FANN (Python / C)
